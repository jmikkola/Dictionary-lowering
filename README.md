# LowerDictPy

This is another attempt at writing dictionary-passing. The plan here is to keep everything else as
easy to work with as possible, meaning (a) an ML-like execution model and (b) a very simple
tree-walking interpreter on the backend.


## Status

Just a skeleton project so far

- I'm porting stuff from dicionarypassing.hs
    - The next thing to port is the lowering logic
- Then, add a simple front-end (ml-ish syntax?)
- And a treewalking interpreter
